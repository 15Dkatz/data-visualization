# Letter Count Bar Chart

In this demo, we asynchronously load a text file, use JavaScript to count the number of times each letter appears in that file, and generate a bar chart showing the letter count in [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) v4.

This is meant to be an introductory demo to expose students to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/), and [blockbuilder.org](http://blockbuilder.org/) for the first time.
